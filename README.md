<P>Thuis Project Using Linear Regression Algorithims to try finding the Price of House depended on many Features</P>
<br>
<h1>The Algorithims Were Used</h1>  
<br>
<h3>Linear Regression Algorithim</h3>
<br>
<p>To fit the data and try to predict the price</p>
<br>
<h3>PolyNomyal Features</h3>
<br>
<p>To fit the data with more one feature</p>
<br>
<h3>Ridge Regression</h3>
<br>
<p>To fit the data witn regularization to reduce overfittinh</p>
